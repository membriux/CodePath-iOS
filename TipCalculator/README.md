## Notes

The main challenges of this app was implementing the theme colors and setting them up accordingly since I have yet to learn App UI Theme Design. The next challenge was implementing the keyboard with the numbers instead of the normal keyboard and including the "Calculate Tip" button on top of the keyboard. The challenge that came after towards the end was implementing the functionality to remember the bill amount across app restarts for no more than 10 minutes. However, after doing some research on the Apple documentation and Googling various topics I was able to figure out how to implement it.
